I have attached the code for the following question.

                                  Cathy works as an editor in a magazine. She is responsible for the games and puzzles
                                  section in the magazine. But unfortunately, she doesnâ€™t have time to go about
                                  creating a puzzle on her own every month. Help her by creating a sudoku validator.
                                          a. It will be a standard 9 X 9 sudoku board
                                          b. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
                                          c. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
                                          d. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9
                                             without repetition.
                                          e. Provide an interface where there will be an empty board.
                                          f. Cathy can type in the squares that she wants with numbers that she wants to.
                                          g. When she clicks on validate, the solution should tell her whether the partially
                                             entered board by her is a valid sudoku board or not
